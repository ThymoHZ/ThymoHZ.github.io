My Programming Experience

I don’t have a lot of experience with programming yet, but it is something that has interested me for a long time. My first real introduction to coding was back in my first year of high school, when I followed a programming course. That was the moment I realized how much I enjoyed learning how computers work and how you can use code to create something from scratch.

Since then, I’ve tried to keep practicing whenever I could. I’ve done some coding tests on websites like Boot.dev and others that give you small challenges to solve. These helped me understand the basics better and also showed me how fun it is to keep improving step by step.

Even though I’m still at the beginning of my programming journey, I’m motivated to keep learning more. I know that the more I practice, the more confident I will become, and I’m excited to see how far I can go with coding in the future.
