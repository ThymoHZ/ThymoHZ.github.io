        <h2>Why i believe im a good fit for the HBO-ICT programme here at HZ.</h2>
        <p>I believe i'm a good fit for the ICT programme since I've been very pasionated about coding for a while now
            and
            have tried multiple types of coding. Personally I found the programme at HZ to most in comfort with my own
            way
            of working. I appreciate the moments where if i can't figure out how to move on I can askk for help and then
            I
            instantly understand, but for the most part I dont mind working alone and figuring stuff out on my own.</p>

        <h2>Things i've done to figure out i wanted to come and study here.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I have visited the open day, here i learned a lot abour the different programmes you can study here.
            </li>
            <li>I have became a student for a day, this showed me the way of working within this vacinitie really works
                quite well into also how i handle studying by myself.</li>
            <li>In the beginning i really didn't know what to expecrt from the different programmes and i wasn't sure on
                which programme would best suit me, that's why I did a stufy quiz to figure out what kind of study
                programme
                would be besty for me.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am eager to join the HBO-ICT programme at HZ University because of my passion for technology,
            problem-solving, and creating practical digital solutions. Through personal projects and team
            collaborations, I have built a solid foundation in programming and learned how to work effectively in group
            settingsâ€”skills that align well with HZ's agile, hands-on approach. I value the small-scale, supportive
            learning environment at HZ and I am motivated to grow further in both software development and data-driven
            innovation. With my dedication, curiosity, and drive to apply ICT in meaningful ways, I am confident I can
            contribute actively to the programme and make the most of the opportunities it offers.
