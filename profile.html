            <p>Some of you will already know my name but incase you don't no need to worry it's Thymo. I am orginaly
                from
                the nederlands but i've spend a long time in Germany when I was young, I basically grew up there. I love
                to
                travel around the world and see many new things, explore different culturs and try cultural foods.</p>

                <figcaption>This is the logo of the Etten-Leur hockey club</figcaption>
                <p class="div2">Hockey has taught me a lot about teamwork, discipline, and pushing myself to improve,
                    both on and off the ice. I really enjoy the competitive aspect, but I also value the friendships and
                    memories I've made through the sport. Outside of hockey, I like to spend my free time exploring new
                    hobbies or just relaxing after a busy week. Cooking, for example, is something I find fun because it
                    lets me be creative, and traveling gives me the chance to experience different cultures and try new
                    foods. Whether I'm diving into a new Marvel release, catching up on an anime series, or just hanging
                    out with friends, I always try to make the most out of my downtime.</p>
