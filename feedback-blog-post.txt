Feedback on My Code

The feedback I received on my code was really helpful. I learned that the way I wrote some of my code wasn’t always the most optimal. One of the main issues was that I had a few spelling mistakes, which is why some of my CSS styles weren’t working correctly.

After fixing those small errors, I was able to track my code more easily and rewrite a small portion to make sure everything worked as it was intended. Once I corrected the mistakes, it became much clearer why it’s important to stay consistent with the use of classes and IDs.

The rest of the feedback was simply about making my code a little more readable, which was an easy fix. Overall, the feedback gave me a better understanding of how small details can have a big impact, and how consistency makes coding smoother and easier to follow.
