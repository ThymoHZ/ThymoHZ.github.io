My Study Choice Journey

Choosing the right study has been a long process for me, but also a very valuable one. I started out not knowing which school or study would suit me best. Because of that, I decided to take a year off school to focus on myself and to figure out what I actually enjoy doing.

During that year, I was able to cross certain studies off my list and also focus more on the most important aspects that schools had to offer me. I didn’t want to rush into a decision, so I really put in the work to explore my options. I took a study choice test, went to an open day, joined an online information session, and even became a student for a day. All of these steps helped me gain more certainty, and in the end, I was able to confidently make my study choice.

Now that I’ve made my decision, my goal is to become more experienced in the field of ICT. I want to improve my coding skills and, in the future, work at different companies to gain more experience. The profession that interests me the most is in the area of cyber security, but I also want to keep programming as an option.

The reason I want to go into this field is because I’ve always been interested in learning how computers work. Back in my first year of high school, I had some coding lessons which I enjoyed a lot, and that interest has stayed with me ever since. Through this program, I hope to learn more about the different aspects of ICT, how to improve the quality of system management, and also discover which skills I’m best at. That way, I can focus on excelling in those areas while continuing to build on the knowledge I already have.

This journey has not only given me clarity, but also motivation. I’m excited to start this next step and see where it takes me in the world of ICT.
